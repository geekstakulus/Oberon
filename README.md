## Welcome to the Oberon-07 C++ parser and code model/browser

This is an Oberon-07 parser and code model written in C++ and Qt. See http://www.projectoberon.net/wirth/Oberon/Oberon07.Report.pdf for more information about the language. The syntax was modified for Coco/R compatibility using https://github.com/rochus-keller/EbnfStudio. 

The goal of this project is to build tools to better understand the Lola-2 compiler and to automatically translate it to maintainable C++ with minimal dependencies to other C++ libraries and with no dependencies to the Oberon System.

### Parser and code model features

- Implements Oberon-07; successfully reads the Oberon System (see http://www.projectoberon.com/) and the Lola-2 compiler (see https://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/wirth/Lola) source code
- Syntax and semantics validation, error reporting
- Infers and synthesizes missing modules

### Code browser features

- Syntax highlighting
- Code navigation; jump to the declaration of an ident
- Mark all idents refering to the same declaration
- List all uses of a declaration for easy navigation
- Browsing history, forward and backward navigation

### Binary version

Here is a binary version of OberonViewer for Windows: http://software.rochus-keller.info/OberonViewer_win32.zip
Just download, unpack and run it; no installer is needed. The ZIP includes the needed Qt libraries.

### Build Steps

Follow these steps if you want to build OberonViewer yourself:

1. Create a directory; let's call it BUILD_DIR
1. Download the Oberon source code from https://github.com/rochus-keller/Oberon/archive/master.zip and unpack it to the BUILD_DIR; rename the subdirectory to "Oberon".
1. Goto the BUILD_DIR/Oberon subdirectory and execute `QTDIR/bin/qmake OberonViewer.pro` (see the Qt documentation concerning QTDIR).
1. Run make; after a couple of seconds you will find the executable in the build directory.

Alternatively you can open OberonViewer.pro using QtCreator and build it there.

The library makes use of a parser generated by Coco/R based on input from EbnfStudio. There is no other dependency than the Qt Core library.
The repository already contains the generated files. In order to regenerate ObParser.cpp/h you have to use this version of Coco/R: https://github.com/rochus-keller/Coco
